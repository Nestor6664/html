                <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and
                    the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use
                    JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your
                    UI using React components: <span class="code">bundles of reusable, nestable code.</span> You can
                    learn more
                    about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>

                <h2>react fundamentals
                    <sup>Chapter 3</sup>
                </h2>
                <p>React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
                    <br> JavaScript. To make the most of React Native,
                    it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher
                    course.
                </p>
                <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                <p><span class="pt_sansbold">+ components.</span>The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
                    examples: friendly, <br> approachable
                    creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>

                <p><span class="pt_sansbold">+ JSX.</span>React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                    elements
                    inside JavaScript like
                    so: <span class="text"> &lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span>.</p>


                <p class="react">The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even
                    more. Because JSX
                    is
                    JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="text">
                        name</span> for the cat, name, and
                    embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="text">&lt;Text&gt;</span> </p>

                <p class="react"><span class="pt_sansbold">+ props.</span>Props is short for "properties".</p>

                <p><span class="bold">+ state</span>While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how
                    components render, state
                    is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over
                    time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>
            </section>

            <section class="fr-section">
                <h2>handling text input<sup>Chapter 4</sup></h2>

                <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span
                        class="code">onChangeText</span> prop that
                    takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
                    takes a
                    function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>

                <p class="rec">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                    language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence
                    "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
